/**
 * <p>
 * The {@code RecurringExpenseService} class encapsulates the business logic for managing recurring expenses.
 * It provides asynchronous methods for retrieving, creating, and updating recurring expense data using reactive types.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This service is responsible for orchestrating data conversion and persistence operations. It delegates data
 * access to the {@link RecurringExpenseRepository} and uses the {@link RecurringExpenseConverter} to convert between
 * entity objects and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The reactive operations in this service are implemented using Mutiny's {@link Uni} and {@link Multi} types, which
 * allow non-blocking, asynchronous processing. This design is especially beneficial in high-concurrency environments
 * where efficient resource utilization is critical.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Key methods provided:</strong>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #getRecurringExpenseById(String)} - Retrieves a recurring expense by its unique identifier.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #getAllRecurringExpense()} - Retrieves all recurring expenses and converts them into a set of response DTOs.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #createRecurringExpense(RecurringExpenseRequestDto)} - Persists a new recurring expense based on the provided DTO.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #updateRecurringExpense(RecurringExpenseRequestDto, String)} - Updates an existing recurring expense using the provided DTO.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is annotated with {@code @ApplicationScoped} to indicate that it is a CDI-managed bean with a
 * lifecycle scoped to the application. Consequently, a single instance of this service is created and shared.
 * </p>
